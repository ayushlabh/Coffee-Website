        <h3>COLD BREW COFFEE</h3>
        <p>
            Cold brew, also called cold water extract or cold press, is the process of steeping coffee
            grounds in water at cool temperatures for an extended period. Coarse-ground beans are soaked
            in water for a prolonged period of time, usually 12 hours or more. The water is normally 
            kept at room temperature, but chilled water is also used. The grounds are filtered out of 
            the water after they have been steeped using a paper coffee filter, a fine metal sieve, a 
            rench press or felt, in the case of the "Toddy" brewing system. The result is a coffee 
            concentrate that is often diluted with water or milk, and is served hot, over ice, or blended
            with ice and chocolate.

        <h3>CAPPUCCINO</h3>
        <p>
            Cappuccino is a coffee-based drink prepared with espresso, hot milk, and steamed milk foam. A
            cappuccino differs from a caffè latte in that it is prepared with much less steamed or textured
            milk than the caffè latte with the total of espresso and milk/foam making up between approximately
            150 and 180 millilitres (5 and 6 US fluid ounces). A cappuccino usually exceeds the height of the 
            cup, making the foam visible above the side of the cup. A cappuccino is traditionally served in a
            porcelain cup, which has far better heat retention characteristics than glass or paper. The foam 
            on top of the cappuccino acts as an insulator and helps retain the heat of the liquid, allowing it
            to stay hotter longer.

         <h3>LATTE</h3>
         <p>
            A latte is an espresso and steamed milk,[50][51] generally in a 1:3 to 1:5 ratio of espresso to milk,
            with a little foam on top.In Italy it is called caffè latte or caffelatte, which means "coffee and milk".
            In northern Europe and Scandinavia the term café au lait has traditionally been used for the combination
            of espresso and milk, but this term is used in the US for brewed coffee and scalded milk. In France,
            caffè latte is mostly known from American coffee chains; a combination of espresso and steamed milk
            equivalent to a latte is in French called grand crème and in German Milchkaffee or Melange. In
            Portuguese it is called galão.
